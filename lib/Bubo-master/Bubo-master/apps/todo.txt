- Create XML file that specifies:
  * location of odometry ladar file
  * units of ladar measurement
  * transform from robot to ladar

- class that creates an occupancy grid map using pure odometry
  * assume ladar is parallel to ground
  * allow an arbitrary number of ladar

-- display display application for all of this

- create an input that reads filtered input from rawlog
  * run through same application as above




-----------------------------------------
- Projects

Visual Odometry
-----------------
- Stereo
  * Triangulate
  * Track in both
  * If reprojection error is large in either image drop
- Mono


SLAM
----------------
- Register using KLT type algorithm
- Map image that is registered:
  - flood fill to get contour of what it might see

Simple to build mapping robot
----------------
- finds sensors
- automatically calibrates geometry
  * determines sensor locations and finds transforms
