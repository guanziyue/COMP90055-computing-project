- speed benchmark for scan-to-scan registration

- ICP do forward/backwards validation of associations

----------
native:
- monolithic binary logs
- directory based
- xml

some structures used for detection are also should be in fitting?

-----------
EKF localization with known landmarks
* Create a landmark map
* Landmark simulation where robot traverses map and logs observations + odometry
  - velocity control
  - odometry model
* EKF
  - Velocity and odometry support
  - continuous time support for velocity?
  - Specialized data type for obsrevations (bearing, range, accuracy_r , accuracy_theta)
* Evaluation App
  - Robot pose
  - Landmark Location
* Try creating an information matrix localization?
