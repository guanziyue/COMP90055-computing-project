/**
 * <p>
 * Class for applying 3D kernels to {@link bubo.maps.d3.grid.impl.OctreeGridMap_F64} which
 * takes advantage of the maps sparse data structure.  Any {@link bubo.maps.d3.grid.impl.Kernel3D_F64}
 * can be used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that most of the neighbor nodes surrounding a 'known' node in the input have
 * a value of 'defaultValue'.  This type of sparse structure is taken advantage of by having each node with
 * a known value push its information on to its neighbors.  This is a re-ordering of the usual convolution
 * computation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: If a cell is along the map's border cells outside the map will be treated as having a value
 * of 'defaultValue'.  A better way would be to reweigh it based on the cells which are inside the image.
