- put all the mathematics into separate class with static functions
  * Functions will contain different ways to implement a Kalman or EKF
- Then have different styles of kalman filter call those functions
- Explicit computation of S inverse and using solve for example

- abstracted interfaces in abst package with wrappers around low level code
